# Book Database Project
Treehouse Data Analysis Tech Degree Unit 4 project: building a console app for a book database.

## Functionality
This app lets you preform CRUD operations on a book database. It includes a suggested_books csv that was used to populate the database. Once create functionality was written, additional books were added to the database. 

Users can view a list of all books, add a book, search for and then edit or delete a book, and view a simple analysis of the books in the database.
